      aboutAlpha:
        intro-title: The Christian student association of Enschede
        intro: 
          C.S.V. Alpha was founded in 1980 and is the Christian social student association 
          in Enschede, where socializing and Christian formation are combined into one unique 
          student association. Alpha's core principle is "the message of the Bible as a 
          guideline for life". This principle is expressed in the aspects of friendship, 
          personal development and responsibility, the essence of the association.
        vriendschap-title: Friendship
        vriendschap-text:
          Our own bar Flux is the ideal place to build and maintain friendships. 
          Every Thursday we meet here, it is the place where drinks and good conversation go hand in hand.
        vorming-title: Personal development
        vorming-text: At Alpha, we value personal development. This development expresses itself 
          in activities such as association evenings, sing-ins and, of course, the biweekly (bible) study.
        verantwoordelijkheid-title: Responsibility
        verantwoordelijkheid-text:
          Alpha is an association for and by its members. That is why members are encouraged to be 
          committed to the association, but also to their environment. This can be done, 
          for example, through committees, boards or volunteer actions.

        'Heyhey! I am Laurens. In my first year as student, I joined Alpha.
        During the Kick-In I came in touch with the association. In the beginning,
        I doubted whether I wanted to join a student association, but I wanted to
        make new (Christian) friends in my new surroundings. I never regretted this
        decision. In my first year, I made many new contacts and enjoyed the activities.
        From studying, doing sports and drinking some beers with each other, to epic
        weekends in and out of the country. '
      laurens2:
        Results after the first year? New friendships, deep and good conversations
        about religion and I have gained many new experiences in committees. After
        half a year I started living in an Alpha house. Living together with Christian
        students is really cool and fulfilling. As a house we also organise epic activities
        and everyone is always welcome! In short, are you looking for a fun time,
        friendship and a challenge in your religious life, then Alpha is something
        for you!
      luuk1:
        'Hey, I am Luuk. When I came to Enschede I did not join a student association
        immediately, because I didn’t think it would be something for me. After studying
        for a year a friend of me brought me along to a drink of Alpha. I had such
        a great evening there, that I seriously started thinking about joining an
        association. After a few introduction activities, I knew it for sure, I was
        joining Alpha. '
      luuk2:
        Up until this day I definitely have not regretted my decision. At Alpha
        I made friends, participated in committees and started thinking about religion
        more in-depth. From serious conversations to fun drinks and every now and
        then a nice party, that is exactly the combination that I like about Alpha.
        Are you interested? Drop by sometime!
      susan:
        'Hi hi, my name is Susan. When I came to Enschede two years ago I never
        planned on joining a student association. Nevertheless, some of my housemates
        dragged me to Alpha and I was sold immediately. Due to the large diversity
        of the association, there is always something new to experience. Sometimes
        that is an awesome committee and another time that is a good long conversation
        in the pub. Also regarding religion there is something for everyone, with
        very diverse bible study groups, which you can choose, you can decide what
        you want to study for that year. This way, I believe, that Alpha gives you
        a lot of space to grow and discover in your religion. I have to thank Alpha
        regarding a lot of my personal development, and I would make the decision
        to join again in a split second. Does it seem like fun? Drop by sometime and
        taste the atmosphere for yourself! '
      afke1:
        Heyhey! Even before moving to Enschede, I had already heard great stories
        about Alpha. During the introduction period, I joined a lot of activities
        and got to know Alpha even better and I decided to become a member. Meanwhile,
        a year has past and I still enjoy it a lot!
      afke2:
        What really speaks to me is that everyone is always welcome in the association.
        There are members from different churches and also those without religion,
        but everyone hangs out with everyone and everyone has fun with each other.
        I, myself, am not religious, but I definitely feel me at home within Alpha.
        The good conversations, the friendships and epic drinks and parties in our
        pub make sure that Alpha is a great completion of my time as a student in
        Enschede!
