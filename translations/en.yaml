        info: Alpha is a Christian student association. Our great ambiance will make
          you feel at home in no time. With over a hundred members we are often named
          THE Christian student association of Enschede.  We love to have good conversation
          while enjoying a few beers in our own pub 'Flux' in the Pakkerij on the Oude
          Markt. Feel welcome to come by anytime!

        slogan: For those who believe in a student time!
        info: The Pakkerij is located on the Oude Markt. This impressive white building
          houses four student associations. Located on the top floor is 'Flux', the
          pub of C.S.V. Alpha.  Every Thursday-night drinks will take place here, but
          Flux is also used for Sing-Ins, theme-nights and sometimes will be hired by
          others.

        laurens1: 'Heyhey! I am Laurens. In my first year as student, I joined Alpha.
          During the Kick-In I came in touch with the association. In the beginning,
          I doubted whether I wanted to join a student association, but I wanted to
          make new (Christian) friends in my new surroundings. I never regretted this
          decision. In my first year, I made many new contacts and enjoyed the activities.
          From studying, doing sports and drinking some beers with each other, to epic
          weekends in and out of the country. '
        laurens2: Results after the first year? New friendships, deep and good conversations
          about religion and I have gained many new experiences in committees. After
          half a year I started living in an Alpha house. Living together with Christian
          students is really cool and fulfilling. As a house we also organise epic activities
          and everyone is always welcome! In short, are you looking for a fun time,
          friendship and a challenge in your religious life, then Alpha is something
          for you!
        luuk1: 'Hey, I am Luuk. When I came to Enschede I did not join a student association
          immediately, because I didn’t think it would be something for me. After studying
          for a year a friend of me brought me along to a drink of Alpha. I had such
          a great evening there, that I seriously started thinking about joining an
          association. After a few introduction activities, I knew it for sure, I was
          joining Alpha. '
        luuk2: Up until this day I definitely have not regretted my decision. At Alpha
          I made friends, participated in committees and started thinking about religion
          more in-depth. From serious conversations to fun drinks and every now and
          then a nice party, that is exactly the combination that I like about Alpha.
          Are you interested? Drop by sometime!
        susan: 'Hi hi, my name is Susan. When I came to Enschede two years ago I never
          planned on joining a student association. Nevertheless, some of my housemates
          dragged me to Alpha and I was sold immediately. Due to the large diversity
          of the association, there is always something new to experience. Sometimes
          that is an awesome committee and another time that is a good long conversation
          in the pub. Also regarding religion there is something for everyone, with
          very diverse bible study groups, which you can choose, you can decide what
          you want to study for that year. This way, I believe, that Alpha gives you
          a lot of space to grow and discover in your religion. I have to thank Alpha
          regarding a lot of my personal development, and I would make the decision
          to join again in a split second. Does it seem like fun? Drop by sometime and
          taste the atmosphere for yourself! '
        afke1: Heyhey! Even before moving to Enschede, I had already heard great stories
          about Alpha. During the introduction period, I joined a lot of activities
          and got to know Alpha even better and I decided to become a member. Meanwhile,
          a year has past and I still enjoy it a lot!
        afke2: What really speaks to me is that everyone is always welcome in the association.
          There are members from different churches and also those without religion,
          but everyone hangs out with everyone and everyone has fun with each other.
          I, myself, am not religious, but I definitely feel me at home within Alpha.
          The good conversations, the friendships and epic drinks and parties in our
          pub make sure that Alpha is a great completion of my time as a student in
          Enschede!
