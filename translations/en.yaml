      intro: "C.S.V. Alpha was founded in 1980 and is the Christian social association in
        Enschede where fellowship and Christian development are combined into one unique student association."
      paragraph2: "Alpha’s foundation is \"the message of the Bible as a guideline for life.\" When you join,
        you can choose whether to endorse or respect this foundation. This means we are open not only to Christians,
        but also to anyone who respects the Christian faith. With this foundation, Alpha’s Christian character is preserved,
        while at the same time Alpha is a suitable association for people from all kinds of backgrounds."
      three-vs:
        title: "The 3 V’s"
        intro: "This foundation is expressed in the three core aspects of the association: friendship, formation, and responsibility.
          The association is built around these three core aspects, and everything we do aligns with them:"
        vriendschap: "Our own society, Flux, is the ideal place to build and maintain friendships. Every Thursday
          we meet here, it’s the place where a drink and a good conversation go hand in hand. In addition to our weekly
          casual gatherings on Thursdays, several (themed) parties are held in Flux each year. Many Alpha members are eager
          to join in, often showing up in the most creative outfits. Activities at the bar are perfect for building friendships,
          but there are also plenty of opportunities outside of it. Having lunch together in the boardroom at the university,
          getting invited to an Alpha house for dinner, or playing a game of volleyball in the city park; it’s all possible!"
        vorming: "At Alpha, personal development is a high priority. This formation takes shape in activities
          such as association evenings, sing-ins, and of course the biweekly “kring” (small group). At the start of each year,
          you choose a group that suits you, meeting once every two weeks. After a good meal, we discuss serious topics that matter to us,
          both in terms of faith and social issues. Several times a year, the whole association comes together for the association evening,
          where we listen to a speaker and worship God with Alpha’s band. Thanks to the diversity of Christian backgrounds within the association,
          there is always room for an engaging discussion where every opinion matters!"
        verantwoordelijkheid: "Alpha is an association run by and for its members. Members are encouraged to contribute
          not only to the association but also to the wider community. This can be done through committees, boards, or volunteer work.
          Taking on this responsibility contributes to personal growth and prepares you for “adult” life. All activities offered by Alpha
          are organized by Alpha members through various committees. This includes organizing large events such as the gala, a ski trip,
          and weekend getaways, as well as “smaller” evening activities, such as a formation night or a sports event, there’s something for everyone!"

        intro-title: The Christian student association of Enschede
        intro:
          C.S.V. Alpha was founded in 1980 and is the Christian social student association
          in Enschede, where socializing and Christian formation are combined into one unique
          student association. Alpha's core principle is "the message of the Bible as a
          guideline for life". This principle is expressed in the aspects of friendship,
          personal development and responsibility, the essence of the association.

        'Heyhey! I am Laurens. In my first year as student, I joined Alpha.
        During the Kick-In I came in touch with the association. In the beginning,
        I doubted whether I wanted to join a student association, but I wanted to
        make new (Christian) friends in my new surroundings. I never regretted this
        decision. In my first year, I made many new contacts and enjoyed the activities.
        From studying, doing sports and drinking some beers with each other, to epic
        weekends in and out of the country. '
      laurens2:
        Results after the first year? New friendships, deep and good conversations
        about religion and I have gained many new experiences in committees. After
        half a year I started living in an Alpha house. Living together with Christian
        students is really cool and fulfilling. As a house we also organise epic activities
        and everyone is always welcome! In short, are you looking for a fun time,
        friendship and a challenge in your religious life, then Alpha is something
        for you!
      luuk1:
        'Hey, I am Luuk. When I came to Enschede I did not join a student association
        immediately, because I didn’t think it would be something for me. After studying
        for a year a friend of me brought me along to a drink of Alpha. I had such
        a great evening there, that I seriously started thinking about joining an
        association. After a few introduction activities, I knew it for sure, I was
        joining Alpha. '
      luuk2:
        Up until this day I definitely have not regretted my decision. At Alpha
        I made friends, participated in committees and started thinking about religion
        more in-depth. From serious conversations to fun drinks and every now and
        then a nice party, that is exactly the combination that I like about Alpha.
        Are you interested? Drop by sometime!
      susan:
        'Hi hi, my name is Susan. When I came to Enschede two years ago I never
        planned on joining a student association. Nevertheless, some of my housemates
        dragged me to Alpha and I was sold immediately. Due to the large diversity
        of the association, there is always something new to experience. Sometimes
        that is an awesome committee and another time that is a good long conversation
        in the pub. Also regarding religion there is something for everyone, with
        very diverse bible study groups, which you can choose, you can decide what
        you want to study for that year. This way, I believe, that Alpha gives you
        a lot of space to grow and discover in your religion. I have to thank Alpha
        regarding a lot of my personal development, and I would make the decision
        to join again in a split second. Does it seem like fun? Drop by sometime and
        taste the atmosphere for yourself! '
      afke1:
        Heyhey! Even before moving to Enschede, I had already heard great stories
        about Alpha. During the introduction period, I joined a lot of activities
        and got to know Alpha even better and I decided to become a member. Meanwhile,
        a year has past and I still enjoy it a lot!
      afke2:
        What really speaks to me is that everyone is always welcome in the association.
        There are members from different churches and also those without religion,
        but everyone hangs out with everyone and everyone has fun with each other.
        I, myself, am not religious, but I definitely feel me at home within Alpha.
        The good conversations, the friendships and epic drinks and parties in our
        pub make sure that Alpha is a great completion of my time as a student in
        Enschede!
